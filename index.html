      Bears are large mammals belonging to the family Ursidae and are found in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. They are typically characterized by their stocky bodies, strong limbs, large paws with claws, and shaggy fur. Bears are generally omnivores, though their diets vary widely depending on the species, the season, and available food sources.

    <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-10-30 221345.png" alt = "Giraffes Image" width="500">
      <p>
        Giraffes are fascinating creatures known for their long necks and unique appearance. They are the tallest land animals, with males (called bulls) standing up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) tall, while females (called cows) are slightly shorter. Giraffes are native to the savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands of Africa, where they primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers from tall trees, especially acacias.

    <h2> Lions </h2>
    <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-10-30 221407.png" alt = "Lions Image" width="500">    
      <p>
        Lions (Panthera leo) are large carnivorous mammals that belong to the Felidae family. They are often referred to as the "king of the jungle," although they actually inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands, primarily in Africa, with a small population in the Gir Forest of India.
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mella</li> 
        <p>
          Mella is a beta female that mostly keeps to herself. She stays in the corners of the habitat and will do anything to avoid conflict.
        </p>
      <li> Karl </li>
        <p>
          Karl spends his days sleeping, fighting, eating, and marking his territory. He is cantankerous and always finds a way to stay in the middle of situations. Some lions in the African savannah have been known to go rogue and turn into maneaters after humans intruded on and proceeded to systematically destroy their habitat, as was the chilling case of the Ghosts of Tsavo. Luckily, this particular lion is just regularly aggressive and will mainly not stray too far from its regular diet. Best not to tempt fate and agitate it, though ...

    <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-10-30 221440.png" alt = "Monkeys Image" width="500">
      <p>
        Monkeys are a diverse group of primates that belong to the infraorder Simiiformes, which also includes apes and humans. They are primarily divided into two main categories: New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.

      <ul>
        <li> Cookie </li>
          <p>Cookie is a brightly colored baboon that loves to swing around the trees, fully exploring his habitat, and never to be found in the same place for two minutes. She is hyperactive and always on the move.</p>
        <li> Earl </li>
          <p>Earl is a tempermental chimpanzee that constantly butts heads with the other monkeys, often throw his excrement at them and at the zookeepers.</p>
        <li> Banana Pudding </li>
          <p>
            Banana Pudding is an elderly silverback gorilla that sometimes tries to attack the glass dividers between the habitat and the guests. Thankfully, the glass is thick enough to contain the mighty beast, but some habitat glass has been known to begin to crack from the thrown around full weight of an 800 lbs gorilla. Best left in peace ...

    <h2> Alligators </h2>
    <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-10-30 221512.png" alt = "Alligator Image" width="500">
      <p>
        Alligators are large reptiles belonging to the family Alligatoridae, which includes two extant species: the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and the Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis).
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Wren </li>
        <p>Wren lays around in the swamps waiting for any unfortunate prey to come along get within striking distance.</p>
      <li> Aspen </li>
        <p>Aspen is a young alligator that likes to explore his environment. He is perhaps a little too social, striding right up to humans with no regard for just how dangerous he or the other animals may be. Always playful, Earl does not bite. But that doesn't mean you should tempt fate and go full Crocodile Hunter, as even though Earl is largely domesticated and friendly around trainers, he will not hesitate to instinctually bite anything that gets too close to his mouth.</p>
      <li> Mika </li>
        <p>
          Mika has a voracious appetite and usually demands seconds whenever the trainers come around with snacks.
